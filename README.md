# student-counter-app


**I have created this student counter app using basic HTML , CSS and JavaScript.**






****In this application we are keeping track of total students who are attending seminars , on a daily and weekly basis.
This user-friendly application can be used to make sure that more students attend the seminars everyday , by keeping track of previous days and weeks.****






*This is a totally front-end based application which doesn't involve use of any framework*
