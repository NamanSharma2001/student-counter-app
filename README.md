# student-counter-app
I have created this student counter app using basic HTML , CSS and JavaScript.

-> In this application we are keeping track of total students who are attending seminars , on a daily and weekly basis.
-> This user friendly application can be used to make sure that more students attend the seminars everyday.


This is a totally front-end based application which doesn't involve any framework.
